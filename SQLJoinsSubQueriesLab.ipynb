        "In this lab assessment, you'll practice your knowledge of JOIN statements and subqueries, using various types of joins and various methods for specifying the links between them. One of the main benefits of using a relational database is the table relations that define them which allow you to access and connect data together via shared columns. By writing more advanced SQL queries that utilize joins and subqueries you can provide a deeper and more granular level of analysis and data retrieval.\n",

You will take a deeper dive into this database in order to accomplish more advanced SQL queries that require you to access data from multiple tables at once. \n",
